# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-ML-Models
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of heart disease. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms, we analyze patient data to identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart conditions. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable tool for healthcare professionals that can assist in diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

Features
Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its features.
Preprocessing: Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and normalization.
Model Training: Implementation of multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
Evaluation: Comprehensive model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Graphical representation of results and model performance using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Deployment: Instructions for deploying the model using Flask for real-time predictions (optional).

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is derived from Framingham, containing various attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical information.
